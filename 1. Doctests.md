# First
*What is DOCSTRING?*

Docstring is a block of comments inside python scripts. For example:

# Second
*How can I place tests inside DOCSTRING?*

```python
"""This is your first python scripe"t with docstrings included.
You can place here block of text as well as scripts.
"""

import os
import random

FIRST_TUPLE = (5,5)
firstObject = {'name': "Peter", 'age': 25}

def clear():
  """Clear the screen"""
  os.system('cls' if os.name == 'nt' else 'clear')

def build_from_tuple(x_axis, y_axis):
  """Create and return a grid from FIRST_TUPLE

  >>> cells = build_from_tuple(2, 2)
  >>> len(cells)
  4

  """
  cells = []
  for y in range(y_axis):
    for x in range(x_axis):
      cells.append((x,y))
  return cells
```

In ```build_from_tuple()``` method there's the docstring where we've declared a test.
Every line of test strats with ```>>> ``` and first line after is value that's expected to occur. So for this method, after declaring 2x2 grid we should get 4 elements inside cells array.

# Third
*More coverage!!!*

```python
def get_locations(cells):
  """Randomly picked starting locations on 3x3 grid checking if they are free

  >>> cells = build_from_tuple(3,3)
  >>> cell_1, cell_2, cell_3 = get_locations(cells)
  >>> cell_1 != cell_2 and cell_2 != cell_3
  True
  >>> cell_3 in cells
  True

  """
  occupied_cell_1 = random.choice(cells)
  occupied_cell_2 = random.choice(cells)
  occupied_cell_3 = random.choice(cells)

  if occupied_cell_1 == occupied_cell_2 or occupied_cell_1 == occupied_cell_3 or occupied_cell_2 == occupied_cell_3:
    occupied_cell_1, occupied_cell_2, occupied_cell_3 = get_locations(cells)

  return occupied_cell_1, occupied_cell_2, occupied_cell_3

```

# Fourth
*Can I write scripts inside Terminal?*

You can also **write tests** (based on previously written scripts) **inside Terminal**:
```bash

python
>>> cells = build_from_tuple(2, 2)
>>> len(cells)
4

```
With this example **it's all about firing up python** inside Terminal, making every step in CLI **and copy steps with returned value inside docstring in your script**

# Fifth
*Friendly fire - how to run tests?*

There's way to start the python wscript along with running tests inside it, but you can run it explicitly:

```bash
python -m doctest your_script.py
```

Whole script with tests inside you will find in */examples* directory. Feel free to run it and see hw it goes. In this snippet ```-m doctest``` stand for running *module* doctest that fires every test you wrote.

---

To start test inside the script you need to place:

```python

import doctest
doctest.testmod()

```

If nothing comes back, **that's good!!!**
