# First
*First step with unit tests*

All the code that we need for writing unit test are stored in ```unittest``` python standard library you can import as any other module.


**Testcase** is a class containing methods with tests and helping methods.

To write unit test you need to create script with your tests, for example *tests.py* - completed one you'll find in */examples* directory. Here's how it's structured:

```python

import unittest

import examples/moves

class MoveTests(unittest.TestCase):
  def test_two_plus_two(self):
    assert 5 + 5 == 10

  def test_one_plus_one(self):
    assert not 1 + 1 == 3

```

Remember: **unittest tests need to start with test_ prefix**.

We've defined class ```MoveTest``` and included TestCase - this is element of unit tests created for groupping tests. In this example it's all about tests related to ```Move``` class.

```python
assert 5 + 5 == 10
```

In tests ``` assert``` stands for *"Everything behind this is supposed to be truth"*

# Second
*Run, Forest, run!*

To run this test you can also (same as with doctests) type:

```bash
python -m unittest tests
```

To run this test without ```module``` flag included, you can just add this into code:
```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
  unittest.main()
```
