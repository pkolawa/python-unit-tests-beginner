*Another way to look at assertions*

Assertions met the conditions that must be meets.
In python there are few different assertions that test different conditions.

```setUp()``` - Method that is run before each test. Use this to set up state for the tests
```assertEqual(x, y)``` - Make sure x and y are equal
```assertNotEqual(x, y)``` - Make sure x and y are not equal
```assertGreater(x, y)``` - Make sure x is greater than y
```assertLess(x, y)``` - Make sure x is less than y
